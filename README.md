# growing_rectangular_plate
Here, we are solving the buckling problem of rectangular plate for which analytical solution is already exist (refer Wang et. al., (2018), doi: 10.1016/j.jmps.2017.10.017). We provide the numerical solution using compound matrix method. The obtained results are provided in the paper -- (Mehta et. al., (2021), 10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2021.03.013)
